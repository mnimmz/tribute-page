      <h3 class="bio-header">Biography</h3>
      <p class="bio-text">Reverend Vandroth Backus was known for many great things, including being one of the first Black police officers in Florence, South Carolina, as well as serving in the United States Marines, being part of a select group trained out of Montford Point, North Carolina, who helped desegregate the military. Backus also was employed as an educator in Darlington County for 14 years, was a member of the board of directors at Morris College and a Florence County councilman. When he retired from teaching, he entered into the ministry and founded the Monumental Missionary Baptist Church in Florence and the Backus Funeral Home. He was very devoted to his community as well as his family. Vandroth Backus passed away on December 26, 2016. He is survived by his wife, Florence, and three children. As his great niece, I truly appreciate his legacy.</p>
